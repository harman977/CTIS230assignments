	<p class="p1">The <strong> hypothesis </strong> for the light being off and not turning on would be; Is the light turned off everywhere in the house or only in that vicinity? I would test the hypothesis by observing the house in other areas, like different rooms.</p>
I would also check if the light bulb is out and test and it and observe it. Based on my results, the light bulb needed to be changed. <b> Qualitative observations </b> uses senses to observe the results, like sight, smell, touch, taste, and hear. Quantitative uses instruments for observations. The instruments are rulers, balances, graduated cylinders, beakers, and thermometers. The results are measurable.

	Trying out different types of candies by tasting them is qualitative observation. Using a ruler to measure the length of a piece of paper is quantitative. A good hypothesis is B. E. coli cells will die within 8 hours if it is exposed to temperatures below <em> 80°F </em> because its testable and it states the problem. </p>
<p> The experiments that the scientists performed was the toxin verotoxin, which was injected into the human brain tumors which were implanted into mice. The hypothesis was to see if verotoxin can shrink down tumors without the excruciating side effects from chemotherapy. The data that was collected was to see how much verotoxin would it take to make an ape sick. </p>
<p > 
	
	The conclusion was that you can see a big difference in <i> 90 minutes </i> in the cancer cells. Verotoxin stops the growth of new blood vessels too. What I think that was left out of the study was, the study when they testes how much verotoxin it would take for the ape to get sick, I don’t see any data for it or anymore information.  Yes I think the title of the article is an accurate statement because in the study it explains that it shrinks the cancer cells/ tumor.</p> <br>
