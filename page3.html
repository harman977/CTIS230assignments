<p>What is cortical fusi? What is the abundance, size, shape, and distribution of the cortical fusi in a typical human hair shaft? Explain any color associated with the cortical fusi when viewed under the compound light microscope. Consult and cite multiple sources.
Cortical fusi are air sacs found in hairs. They are normally positioned somewhere around the hair's root, but they can be found at any other part of the hair. They come in different shapes and sizes . Abundance is the number of the hair growing on a particular region of the body more than any other part. For example, the scalp . Since they are air sacs, they don't have a specific color, but they can be dark-colored. </p>
<p>How can the forensic investigator determine if scissors, razors, or clippers were used to cut a suspect's hair? Describe the expected appearance of the cut end. Cite your sources.
If the strand of the hair were cut using the scissors, the cut end surface would be perpendicular to the hair's longitudinal height. For razor blades, the cut end surface will be diagonal to the hair strand height. Lastly, for clippers, the cut end tip will be in the form of a wedge as clippers squeeze the hair before cutting. Each cuts the hair depending on the nature of the tool used. For example, the scissors cut from both sides and preserve the cross-sectional area shape of the hair. </p>

	<img  class="img3"  src="image2.png" alt="Hair Follicle" width="250">What is the appearance of split ends? What are some conditions that can lead to split ends of hair shafts?  
The split ends of a hair look like two separate strands that are sticking away from each other from the hair shaft . Hair split at the end because they are dry, frayed, or brittle and form a V shape.  This is not a permanent change, and so, it can be treated by seeing a psychiatry  . </p>
<p>What is the cellular nature of the medulla? Describe each of these medullary forms: continuous, interrupted, fragmented, and absent. Cite your sources.
The medulla is made up of three sections, the serpentine, the inner, and the outer layer . The serpentine separates the inner from the outer medulla. The three types of the medulla are continuous, interrupted fragmented and the absent. The continuous medulla is a type in which the medulla is formed as a solid in the hair center. Interrupted type is where it is seen as one individual cell. The next example is fragmented. In this type of hair, there is little or no medulla in the air. </p> <br>
